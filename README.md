# Wisk
A C# powered Unity prototype for a cycling RPG that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) inputs from an indoor cycling trainer.

This game was created in a couple of weeks as a project for my internship. 
In the end the world was imagined to have several different bioms that have specific characteristics, i.e. their own cultures, peoples and more.
Now, obviously a couple of weeks is not enough to create a game like that, but I did give it a try.

Here is a demonstration of the latest version (which still needs some bug fixing): https://youtu.be/jzBiU5GvRyg
